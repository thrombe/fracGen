plan:
  . use xyrange()
  . explain how generation works in comments
  . test polunomialDist for more functions

try:
  . buddhabrot but include the points that dont cross 2. ie dont ignore points inside mandlebrot set
  . superimpose mandlebrot on top of few already made buddhabrot images but in different color
  . convolutions on fractals/random images
  . smart long gaussian? blur like the computerphile video
  . the logistic curve or something (veritassium video)
  . lorenz attractor and ++ +3d?
  . chaos equations from code parade
  . the complex cellular automata from sabestian lague
  . 

mandlebrot:
  . 1/(1+e^-(it - offset))
